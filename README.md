# Abstract


Electrooxidation has emerged as an increasingly viable platform in molecular syntheses that can avoid stoichiometric chemical redox agents. Despite major progress in electrocatalyzed C−H activations, these arene functionalizations generally require directing groups to enable the C−H activation. The installation and removal of these directing groups calls for additional synthesis steps, which jeopardizes the inherent efficacy of the electrochemical C−H activation approach, leading to undesired waste with reduced step and atom economy. In sharp contrast, herein we present palladium-electrocatalyzed C−H olefinations of simple arenes devoid of exogenous directing groups. The robust electrocatalysis protocol proved amenable to a wide range of both electron-rich and electron-deficient arenes under exceedingly mild reaction conditions, avoiding chemical oxidants. This study points to an interesting approach of two electrochemical transformations for the success of outstanding levels of position-selectivities in direct olefinations of electron-rich anisoles. Physical organic parameters-based machine learning models were developed to enable the regioselectivity prediction in electrochemical C−H olefinations. Furthermore, late-stage functionalizations set the stage for the direct C−H olefinations of structurally complex pharmaceutically relevant compounds, thereby avoiding protection and directing group manipulations.
